=head1 NAME

Overnet::Burner::Worker::SubscriptionAbuser - subscription-exhaustion abuse worker

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.001.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Overnet::Burner::Worker::SubscriptionAbuser;

  Overnet::Burner::Worker::SubscriptionAbuser->new(input => $input)->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Perl reference implementation of the C<subscription_abuser> abuse role
under the contract in F<docs/abuse.md>. It opens a stream of distinct
subscriptions and never closes them, so they accumulate on the connection,
and measures whether the relay bounds them: a C<CLOSED> refusal is the
correct defense, while an C<EOSE> that opens yet another unbounded
subscription is a defense failure. The abuse is subscription-count
exhaustion; deliberately expensive filters are future work.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Fatal worker errors are raised via C<croak>; a refused subscription is a
metric event, not a worker failure.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Configuration arrives through the worker input document; see
F<docs/workers.md> and F<docs/abuse.md>.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

See the distribution metadata for runtime dependencies.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

No known incompatibilities are documented.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No known bugs are documented.
