=head1 NAME

Overnet::Burner::Worker::ProvenanceForger - forged-provenance abuse worker

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.001.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Overnet::Burner::Worker::ProvenanceForger;

  Overnet::Burner::Worker::ProvenanceForger->new(input => $input)->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Perl reference implementation of the C<provenance_forger> abuse role
under the contract in F<docs/abuse.md>. It publishes adapted events that
claim an external origin the worker is not authoritative for: each event
carries adapted provenance for a target origin but is signed by the
worker's own identity rather than the adapter identity an authority record
binds to that origin.

Unlike the relay-facing abuse roles, its defense does not live at the
relay. A relay is a dumb carrier and accepts the forged event (Overnet core
specification section 7.7); the forgery is meant to be caught at the
consumer-side provenance verification boundary (section 7.9). The worker
therefore measures the verification outcome, not the relay acknowledgement:
it verifies each forged event with the reference oracle
L<Overnet::Burner::Provenance> against the authority record a consumer would
hold, and records C<forged> as the correct defense and C<authoritative> as
the forgery succeeding.

The target origin, protocol, and the authority record's origin scope are
configurable through C<workload.abuse.provenance_forger>; the defaults forge
an IRC channel origin against a network-scoped authority record.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Fatal worker errors are raised via C<croak>; a forged event resolved as
authoritative is a metric event recording a defense failure, not a worker
failure.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Configuration arrives through the worker input document; see
F<docs/workers.md> and F<docs/abuse.md>.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

See the distribution metadata for runtime dependencies.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

No known incompatibilities are documented.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No known bugs are documented.
