=head1 NAME

Overnet::Burner::Guest::Remote - shared remote guest plumbing

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.001.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Overnet::Burner::Guest::SomeRemoteTransport;
  use Moo;
  extends 'Overnet::Burner::Guest::Remote';

  sub transport   { ... }
  sub _capture    { ... }  # run a remote shell command, return (output, status)
  sub _push_file  { ... }  # copy a local file to a remote path

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Every remote transport shares the same problem shape: shell commands on the
guest, files pushed to the guest, and a worker process that must be
launched, signaled, and reaped even though a disowned remote process cannot
be waited on. This base implements the whole guest contract in terms of two
transport primitives - run a remote command capturing output and status,
and push a local file to a remote path. C<launch> stages a supervisor
script that records the worker's pid for signal delivery and writes its
exit status to a file; C<try_reap> reads that status back, and a supervisor
that vanished without writing one is reported as a killed process. A
liveness probe that fails at the transport level reports nothing rather
than a synthetic kill, so a transient connection problem never masquerades
as a dead worker.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 shell_quote

=head2 make_path

=head2 write_file

=head2 read_file

=head2 run_command

Runs one command to completion on the guest, capturing its stdout, stderr,
and exit code back over the transport by staging them in a guest-side temp
directory. Remote guests run in the transport's default working directory,
so a C<cwd> is not accepted here; lifecycle commands placed on a remote
relay guest must not assume the controller's run directory.

=head2 launch

=head2 try_reap

=head2 signal

=head2 reachable

True when the guest answers a trivial command over its transport; used to
wait for constructed guests (containers, virtual machines) to come up.

=head2 ready_actors

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Transport failures are reported through exceptions naming the guest.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

None.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

See the distribution metadata for runtime dependencies.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

No known incompatibilities are documented.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Reaping polls one remote command per worker per cycle, which will need
batching at very high worker counts.
