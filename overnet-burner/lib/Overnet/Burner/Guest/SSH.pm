=head1 NAME

Overnet::Burner::Guest::SSH - the connect guest transport

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.001.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $guest = Overnet::Burner::Guest::SSH->new(
    name    => 'worker-guest-001',
    role    => 'workers',
    address => 'load-1.example.net',
    user    => 'burner',
    key     => '/keys/burner',
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implements the two remote transport primitives of
L<Overnet::Burner::Guest::Remote> over OpenSSH for the C<how: connect>
provisioning method of F<docs/provisioning.md>: commands run through
C<ssh> in batch mode, and files move over C<scp>. All process supervision
comes from the shared remote guest base.

The C<OVERNET_BURNER_SSH> and C<OVERNET_BURNER_SCP> environment variables
override the client binaries, which lets the test suite drive the exact
same command construction through local fakes; a real sshd exercises the
transport when the gated test environment provides one.

=head2 user

=head2 key

=head2 transport

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Transport failures are reported through exceptions naming the guest.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

C<OVERNET_BURNER_SSH> and C<OVERNET_BURNER_SCP> override the ssh and scp
binaries.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

See the distribution metadata for runtime dependencies.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

No known incompatibilities are documented.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Remote paths in scp destinations are not shell-quoted, so run directories
with spaces are unsupported over this transport.
