=head1 NAME

Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Runner - drives a driver against an arena and judges the session

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.001.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $result = Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Runner->new->run(
    driver       => $driver,
    arena        => $arena,
    oracle       => $oracle,
    ground_truth => {authorized_capabilities => [...]},
    session_id   => 'sess-1',
    seed         => '42',
  );
  # $result->{session}, $result->{verdict}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The runner is the orchestration loop of the adversary harness. It repeatedly
asks the driver for the next actions, submits each to the arena, and records
both the action and the arena's observations into a session. When the driver
stops (returns no actions), the runner hands the completed session to the
oracle for judgment and returns both the session and the verdict.

The runner is deliberately policy-free: it neither decides what to attack (the
driver's job) nor what counts as a violation (the oracle's job). It only wires
them together over a single session and enforces a hard C<max_steps> bound so a
runaway driver cannot loop forever. This separation is what lets a scripted
driver, a recorded arena, and a live system under test all run through the same
loop unchanged.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a runner. Takes an optional C<max_steps> (default 1000), the maximum
number of actions the runner will submit before aborting.

=head2 run

Runs one adversary episode. Takes C<driver>, C<arena>, C<oracle>,
C<session_id>, C<seed>, and optional C<ground_truth>. Resets the arena, drives
the driver's actions through it into a fresh session, evaluates the session
with the oracle, and returns C<< { session => $session, verdict => $verdict } >>.

=head2 step

Applies one action to an arena and records it, plus the arena's observations,
into a session. Takes C<arena>, C<session>, and C<action>, and returns an array
reference of the appended observation records. This is the single incremental
step C</run> loops over; it is public so an interactive driver - such as the
adversary server - can advance a session one action at a time.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Missing collaborators, collaborators that do not implement the required
methods, malformed actions or observations, and exceeding C<max_steps> are all
reported with C<croak>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

No module-specific environment configuration is required.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Requires L<Moo> and L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Session>.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None known.
