=head1 NAME

Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Campaign - the discover-then-guard loop over the corpus

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.001.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $corpus   = Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Corpus->new;
  my $campaign = Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Campaign->new(corpus => $corpus);

  # Hunt: sweep every guarded attack's mutation neighbourhood for reopened holes.
  my $sweep = $campaign->hunt(max_variants => 32);
  warn "regression: $_->{base}/$_->{label}" for @{$sweep->{regressions}};

  # Guard: once a hole is closed, promote the attack that found it.
  my $result = $campaign->promote(\%defended_attack);
  # $result->{added} is true only if the attack is defended and novel.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The campaign is the loop that turns the L<fuzzer|Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Fuzzer>
and the L<corpus|Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Corpus> into an autonomous red-team
cycle, composing both without changing either. It splits the discover-then-guard
loop into its two honest halves.

L</hunt> sweeps the mutation neighbourhood of every guarded attack against the
live relay and aggregates the B<regressions> - every variant the oracle now
judges violated, tagged with the base it mutated. Over a hardened relay it finds
nothing; over a regressed relay it surfaces the reopened hole and the minimal
trace that reaches it. hunt only reports.

L</promote> is the guard half: it adds an attack to the corpus only when the
attack is B<currently defended> and B<novel>, so the only thing that ever enters
the corpus is a fresh attack the system already withstands. Promoting a live
violation is refused; promoting a duplicate is a no-op.

The arena is injectable through C<arena_factory>, so the loop runs against the
in-process live relay by default and against a stub in unit tests.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a campaign. Requires C<corpus> (an
L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Corpus>). Takes optional C<arena_factory> (a code
reference C<< sub { my ($base) = @_; ... } >> returning a fresh arena for a base;
default builds the arena through the base's application C<profile> - the IRC
hosted-channel relay unless the base names another - via
L<< Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Corpus/arena_for >>) and C<oracle> (default a new
L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Oracle>).

=head2 hunt

Sweeps the mutation neighbourhood of a set of bases and returns the aggregated
result. Takes optional C<bases> (an array reference of attack descriptors;
default the corpus entries) and optional C<max_variants> (forwarded to the
fuzzer). Returns a hash reference with C<swept> (how many bases ran), C<explored>
(how many variants ran in total), C<regressions> (each C<< {base, label, actions,
verdict} >> for a variant judged violated), and C<errors> (each C<< {base, label,
message} >> for a variant whose run threw).

A regression is reported only when the mutation preserved the base's honest
baseline - the authoritative establishment events the ground truth was computed
against. A base declares that baseline through C<snapshot_signers> (whose
authoritative C<publish_snapshot> events are baseline) and C<baseline_actors>
(whose C<publish_grant> and C<publish_control> events are baseline, for authority
established by a delegated control event rather than a snapshot). A mutation that
drops or alters a baseline event has changed the world the ground truth assumed,
so its verdict is scenario drift and is filtered out rather than misreported as a
reopened hole.

=head2 promote

Adds an attack to the corpus when it is currently defended and novel. Takes the
attack descriptor. Returns C<< {added => 1, name, path} >> on success, C<< {added
=> 0, reason => 'already-guarded', name} >> when an existing entry shares the
attack's canonical action signature, or C<< {added => 0, reason =>
'not-defended', verdict} >> when replaying the attack violates an invariant.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

A missing or unusable C<corpus>, a non-code C<arena_factory>, non-array C<bases>,
or a base without a name or actions are reported with C<croak>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Hunting and promoting against a base whose profile is the IRC hosted-channel
authority require C<Overnet::Authority::HostedChannel::Relay> (the relay dist);
a self-contained profile such as C<document-vault> needs nothing beyond the core
dependencies.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Requires L<Moo>, L<JSON>, L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Corpus>,
L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Fuzzer>,
L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Driver::Scripted>,
L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Oracle>, and
L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Runner>.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None known.
