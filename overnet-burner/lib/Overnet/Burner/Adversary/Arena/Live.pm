=head1 NAME

Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Arena::Live - a live arena driving the real authoritative relay

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.001.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $arena = Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Arena::Live->new(
    snapshot_signers => ['snapshot-authority'],
    seed             => '1',
  );
  $arena->reset;
  my $observations = $arena->apply(
    {type => 'publish_control', payload => {
      signer => 'operator-session', actor => 'operator',
      authority => 'operator-grant', kind => 9000,
      roles => [{subject => 'operator', role => 'irc.operator'}],
    }},
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A live arena drives the real Overnet authoritative hosted-channel relay
(C<Overnet::Authority::HostedChannel::Relay>) in process, so the adversary
catalog replays against the actual hardened authorization code rather than a
recorded transcript. It is the arena a
L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Arena::Recorded> stands in for, and the substrate
of the live regression corpus: driving a seed attack through it and finding no
oracle violation proves the deployed relay still defends that attack.

This class is the reference (IRC hosted-channel) concrete arena. It extends
L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Arena::LiveBase>, which owns the
application-neutral machinery - the reset/apply loop, deterministic identity
derivation, the session clock, the authority symbol table, and the observation
and validation helpers. This class adds only what is specific to the IRC
hosted-channel authority: the relay it builds as its system under test and the
C<_do_E<lt>actionE<gt>> handlers for that authority's vocabulary.

The relay module is loaded lazily (via C<require>) the first time the arena
builds a relay, so this module remains loadable - for style and coverage gates -
even where the relay dist is not on C<@INC>. A caller that intends to
C<reset>/C<apply> must make C<Overnet::Authority::HostedChannel::Relay>
available.

=head2 Identities and scope

Actions name identities and grants symbolically (C<operator>, C<attacker>,
C<operator-grant>). The arena maps each identity name to a deterministic
secp256k1 keypair derived from the arena seed, so a run is reproducible and the
same name always resolves to the same key. An action's symbolic C<group>
resolves to a distinct relay group id (the default group when omitted), so a
scenario can drive more than one group and express cross-group attacks; the
symbolic C<scope> in an action is echoed verbatim into the observations so it
lines up with the oracle's ground truth.

=head2 Deriving observations independently

The arena never trusts an action's claim. Acceptance or rejection of an event
is read from the relay's own C<on_event> decision (C<relay_outcome>). Capability
and admission observations are produced by I<probing> the live relay: to answer
"does this subject hold operator" the arena authorizes - but never stores - a
remove-user operator action for the subject and reports the capability only if
the real relay accepts it; to answer "is this subject admitted" it reads the
relay's decision on the subject's join request. This is what makes the arena's
observations an independent signal the oracle can judge.

=head2 Action vocabulary

Each action is C<< {type => ..., payload => {...}} >>:

=over

=item * C<new_identity> - C<name>: register a deterministic identity.

=item * C<publish_grant> - C<actor>, C<delegate>, optional C<id>: publish a
delegation grant signed by C<actor> delegating to C<delegate>; C<id> records a
symbolic handle a later control event can reference as its authority.

=item * C<publish_control> - C<signer>, C<actor>, C<authority>, C<kind>,
optional C<roles> (list of C<< {subject, role} >>), C<sequence>, C<created_at>,
C<group>, C<smuggle_group>: publish a NIP-29 control event and return the
relay's decision. C<group> selects the group the event is authorized against
(its C<h> tag); C<smuggle_group> additionally binds the event's C<d> tag to a
second group, expressing a cross-group attack that authorizes against one group
while trying to fold into another.

=item * C<publish_snapshot> - C<signer>, C<kind>, optional C<grants>, C<bans>,
C<closed>, C<tombstoned>, C<force_store>, C<group>, C<smuggle_group>, C<actor>,
C<authority>: publish a group snapshot. C<group> selects the group the snapshot
addresses (its C<d> tag) and C<smuggle_group> binds its C<h> tag to a second
group. C<actor>/C<authority> add the delegation tags of a delegated C<39000>
metadata write, and C<tombstoned> marks the group tombstoned. C<force_store>
stores the event even when the relay refuses it, to mirror a forged snapshot
present in the store but ignored in derived state.

=item * C<join> - C<actor>, C<scope>, optional C<mask>, C<group>: submit a join
request and return the relay's decision plus an C<observed_admission>.

=item * C<observe_capability> - C<subject>, C<scope>, optional C<capability>,
C<group>: probe whether the subject holds the capability in the named group and
emit an C<observed_capability> only if the live relay grants it.

=item * C<observe_state> - C<scope>, C<instance>, C<subjects> (list of identity
names), optional C<group>: probe each subject in the named group and emit one
C<observed_state> whose C<state> is the canonical sorted set of subjects the
live relay derives as operators, tagged with the given C<instance>. Two
instances driven the same accepted events in different store orders emit
matching C<observed_state>, which the oracle's convergence invariant judges; a
divergence is a replay-ordering defect.

=item * C<observe_availability> - C<subject>, C<scope>, optional C<group>: probe
whether the subject can still exercise its authority in the named group and emit
an C<observed_availability> whose C<available> flag is false once the group is
tombstoned or the subject's authority is gone. The oracle's availability
invariant judges it against the harness's C<expected_availability>, catching
denial-of-service and channel-takeover attacks.

=item * All group-addressed actions accept an optional C<group> (a symbolic
group name). Omitted, the action targets the arena's default group; named, it
targets a distinct group, so a scenario can drive several groups at once. See
L</Identities and scope>.

=back

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a live arena. Takes optional C<relay_url> (default
C<ws://127.0.0.1:7448>), C<grant_kind> (default 14142), C<group_id>,
C<auth_scope>, C<snapshot_signers> (identity names that are the relay's
authoritative snapshot signers), and C<seed>.

C<store_factory> is an optional code reference returning a fresh relay store;
the arena calls it on each C<reset> so an episode can drive the relay against an
alternate persistence backend - for example a store that hands events back in
delivery order rather than a canonical order, to exercise replay and
duplicate-delivery ordering. When omitted the relay uses its default store.

=head2 baseline_ref

Returns the opaque baseline reference identifying the live system under test.

=head2 reset

Builds a fresh relay with an empty store and clears the identity and grant
registries, so each episode starts from a clean authoritative baseline.
Inherited from L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Arena::LiveBase>.

=head2 apply

Takes one action object, executes it against the live relay, and returns an
array reference of observations derived from the relay's real behavior.
Inherited from L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Arena::LiveBase>.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Invalid constructor arguments, unknown action types, unknown authority
references, and malformed payloads are reported with C<croak>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Requires C<Overnet::Authority::HostedChannel::Relay> (the relay dist) to be on
C<@INC> before C<reset> or C<apply> is called.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Requires L<Moo> and L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Arena::LiveBase>.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None known.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

The arena drives the relay in process rather than over a WebSocket; it exercises
the authorization engine, not the transport. All scopes map onto a single relay
group.
