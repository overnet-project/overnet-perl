# illustrative system-under-test transcripts - the observations a defended
# (spec-conformant) system exposes versus those a vulnerable one exposes. The
# transcripts make each attack a self-contained regression scenario until an
# arena replays the actions against a live system under test.

=head1 NAME

Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Profile::IrcHostedChannel - the IRC hosted-channel adversary profile

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.001.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $catalog = Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Profile::IrcHostedChannel->attack_catalog;
  my $arena   = Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Profile::IrcHostedChannel->build_arena(seed => '1');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The reference adversary application profile: the IRC hosted-channel authority.
It packages the live arena that drives that authority
(L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Arena::Live>), the seed-attack catalog written in
its operator/channel vocabulary, and that vocabulary. Selecting this profile
reproduces the adversary subsystem's original, IRC-specific behavior; it is the
default profile.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 name

Returns C<irc-hosted-channel>.

=head2 build_arena

Builds an arena bound to the IRC hosted-channel authority. By default returns an
in-process L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Arena::Live>; with C<< transport =>
'wire' >> (and a C<relay_url>) it returns an
L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Arena::Wire> that drives a real relay endpoint
over a WebSocket. Remaining arguments pass through to the chosen arena.

=head2 vocabulary

Returns the application vocabulary (capabilities, scopes, grant kinds, and
action types) a fuzzer needs to generate in-model variants.

=head2 attack_catalog

Returns a fresh copy of the seed-attack catalog: a mapping of attack name to an
entry carrying a description, target invariant, ground truth, action sequence,
and the defended and exploited transcripts.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

No diagnostics are emitted directly.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

No module-specific environment configuration is required.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Requires L<Overnet::Burner::Adversary::Arena::Live>.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None known.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Report issues at L<https://github.com/overnet-project/overnet-burner/issues>.
