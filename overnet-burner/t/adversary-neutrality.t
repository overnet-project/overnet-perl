# application plugs into. So the very same generic engine that judges the IRC
# hosted-channel authority must judge a deliberately non-IRC authority - the
# document-vault, where a scope has one owner who alone may delegate write access
# - and reach the correct verdict in both directions. This test drives that
# non-IRC profile through the unmodified engine.
