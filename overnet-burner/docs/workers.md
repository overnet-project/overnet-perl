# overnet-burner Worker Contract

Workers are the load-generating and measuring processes of a run. Rex and the
runners orchestrate them; workers do the high-volume work and record metric
events. Like topology providers, workers are a language-neutral process
boundary: a worker is any executable that honors this contract, whatever it
is written in. The Perl workers in this distribution are reference
implementations.

## Files

The v1 input contract is defined by:

```text
schemas/worker-input-v1.schema.json
```

A representative input document is provided at:

```text
examples/worker-input-v1-sample.json
```

Workers emit metric events under the contract in [METRICS.md](METRICS.md).

## Launch

The runner starts one worker process per plan actor that requires a worker
role. The only required interface is a single environment variable:

```text
OVERNET_BURNER_WORKER_INPUT=/abs/path/to/runs/<run-id>/workers/<worker-id>/input.json
```

Workers MUST read their entire configuration from that JSON document. Workers
SHOULD ignore unrecognized command-line arguments and MUST NOT require any
other environment variables.

## Input Document

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `input_version` | integer `1` | yes | Contract version |
| `run_id` | non-empty string | yes | Run identifier |
| `run_dir` | non-empty string | yes | Absolute run directory |
| `worker_id` | non-empty string | yes | This actor's id (for example `publisher-001`) |
| `role` | non-empty string | yes | Worker role (for example `publisher`) |
| `seed` | integer | yes | Run seed; see Determinism |
| `duration_seconds` | non-negative number | yes | How long the workload phase runs |
| `metric_stream` | non-empty string | yes | Metric stream path, relative to `run_dir` |
| `ready_file` | non-empty string | yes | Readiness marker path, relative to `run_dir` |
| `endpoints` | object | yes | Service endpoints; `endpoints.relays` is an array of relay URLs, assigned relay first |
| `workload` | object | yes | Role-specific workload parameters from the plan (the main phase's parameters) |
| `phases` | array | no | Workload phases in order; see Workload Phases |

Unknown additional fields are compatible v1 extensions; workers MUST ignore
fields they do not understand.

### Relay Assignment

`endpoints.relays` lists every relay endpoint of the run, ordered so the
worker's **assigned** relay comes first. A worker that talks to a single
relay MUST use the first entry; a worker MAY use the remaining entries as
additional targets if its role calls for it. The runner assigns relays
deterministically — round-robin over the run's relay endpoints by the
actor's ordinal — so multi-relay scenarios spread workers across relays
reproducibly.

## Determinism

All worker randomness MUST derive from `seed` and `worker_id` alone, so that
identical scenarios and seeds produce equivalent workloads. Workers MUST NOT
seed from wall-clock time, process ids, or host identity.

## Readiness

A worker MUST create `ready_file` (an empty file is sufficient) once it is
fully operational — connected, subscribed, and able to perform its role —
and before it begins its workload. Orchestration uses readiness to sequence
roles (for example, subscribers must be ready before publishers start, or
fanout measurements are lies).

## Workload Phases

A scenario's workload runs as one to three phases: an optional warmup, the
main phase, and an optional cooldown.

```yaml
run:
  duration: 60          # the MAIN phase; total run = warmup + main + cooldown
workload:
  publish_rate_per_second: 10
  warmup:
    duration: 10
    publish_rate_per_second: 2   # optional per-phase rate overrides
  cooldown:
    duration: 5
    publish_rate_per_second: 0   # an explicit rate of 0 means idle
```

- `run.duration` is the main phase's duration; the total workload window is
  `warmup.duration + run.duration + cooldown.duration`, and
  `duration_seconds` in the worker input is that total.
- `warmup` and `cooldown` may override `publish_rate_per_second`,
  `query_rate_per_second`, and `object_reads.rate_per_second`; anything not
  overridden inherits the main workload's value. Filters and object
  references are constant across phases.
- An **explicit rate of `0`** in any phase means the worker performs no
  operations during that phase (an absent rate still defaults to `1`).
- Workers receive the ordered phase list in the input document's `phases`
  array (each entry carries `name`, `start_seconds`, `duration_seconds`,
  and the phase's workload parameters) and MUST pace each phase by its own
  rates. A worker that receives no `phases` array treats the whole
  `duration_seconds` as a single `main` phase driven by `workload` — which
  is exactly what single-phase runs send.
- In a multi-phase run every metric event MUST carry the `phase` member
  naming the phase the operation ran in. Reports judge the main phase
  only; see [METRICS.md](METRICS.md).

## Metric Emission

Workers append metric events to `metric_stream` under the
[metric event contract](METRICS.md): one complete JSON object per line,
flushed per line. A truncated final line invalidates the stream.

Failures of the system under test are not worker failures: a rejected or
timed-out operation is a metric event with `status: "error"`, and the worker
continues.

## Connection Loss

Losing the connection to the system under test mid-workload is behavior of
the system under test, not a worker failure:

- A worker SHOULD record operations affected by a lost connection as metric
  events with `status: "error"` and attempt to re-establish its connection
  for the remainder of the workload window, rather than exiting non-zero.
- An endpoint that cannot be reached before the workload starts remains a
  fatal worker failure per Exit Semantics; resilience applies only after
  the worker was once operational.
- A subscriber that reconnects MUST re-establish its replay boundary: after
  resubscribing it MUST treat deliveries as stored replay until the next
  boundary (`EOSE`) and MUST NOT measure them as live fanout. A replayed
  stamped event measured against its original `sent_at` would fabricate an
  enormous fanout latency. Events published while the subscriber was
  disconnected are therefore replayed, not measured — the metric stream
  records what was actually observed live.

## Exit Semantics

- Exit code `0`: orderly completion — the workload duration elapsed, or the
  worker shut down cleanly after `SIGTERM`.
- Non-zero exit: fatal worker failure (bad input document, unreachable
  endpoint before the workload started, internal error). The runner treats
  the run as orchestration-failed.
- On `SIGTERM`, a worker MUST stop starting new operations, finish or abandon
  the one in flight, flush its metric stream, and exit `0`.

Standard output and standard error are free-form diagnostics; the runner
captures them under `logs/`.

## Runner Integration

The `rex-local-workers` runner launches one worker process per plan actor
whose role has a reference worker, writes each actor's input document under
`workers/<worker-id>/input.json`, sequences readiness (subscribers and
readers before publishers), waits for orderly exits, and concatenates the
collected streams into the run's aggregated `metrics.jsonl`. Actor roles
without a worker are recorded as explicitly skipped.

### Selecting the Worker Command

The runner resolves the worker command in this order, first match wins:

1. `provision.workers.worker` in the scenario — the per-scenario worker
   command, useful when a guest runs the worker differently from the
   controller (for example a container image's baked-in command, or a
   Python worker in a virtual guest).
2. the `OVERNET_BURNER_WORKER` environment variable — the per-invocation
   override.
3. the reference worker mode of the main CLI. For local workers this is the
   same `overnet-burner` executable that launched the run, invoked as
   `overnet-burner worker`. For non-local guests it is the installed command
   name `overnet-burner worker` on that guest's `PATH`.

Because the command is a full shell word, it may carry arguments: any
contract-compliant executable in any language can serve as the worker.

The legacy `overnet-burner-worker` command remains as a compatibility shim
for scripts that still call it directly. New Overnet-owned commands should
use `overnet-burner worker`.

**Running from an uninstalled checkout.** Local runs no longer need
`OVERNET_BURNER_WORKER` just to find the reference worker. Invoke the main
CLI from the checkout, and local worker processes will use that same file in
`worker` mode. Remote, container, and virtual guests still resolve commands
inside their own filesystem, so install `overnet-burner` there or set
`provision.workers.worker` to a command the guest can run.

For locally provisioned (`how: local`) workers the runner pre-flights the
command before launching any worker and fails fast with an actionable error
naming these command choices when it cannot be resolved, rather than leaving
you to decode a `command not found` from a worker that exited at launch.
Remote, container, and virtual guests resolve the command in their own
filesystem, so give those an absolute path, an installed binary, or a
`provision.workers.worker` the guest can run.

## Fanout Timing

Fanout latency spans two processes, so it needs a shared convention:

- A publisher SHOULD stamp each published event's body with `sent_at`, the
  publish wall-clock time in **milliseconds** since the Unix epoch
  (fractional milliseconds allowed), taken immediately before handing the
  event to the relay connection.
- A subscriber measures `subscription_fanout` as its receive time minus the
  event's `sent_at` stamp, clamped to zero. The metric event SHOULD carry
  `event_id`, `subscription_id`, and `relay_url`.
- Events without a numeric `sent_at` stamp are observed but MUST NOT be
  measured — a fanout latency that guesses its own start time is a lie.
- Stored-event replay delivered before the subscription's replay boundary
  (`EOSE` on Nostr relays) is `subscription_replay`, never
  `subscription_fanout`; a subscriber MUST NOT count replayed events as
  live fanout.

The measurement compares clocks across processes. On a single host it is
trustworthy; in distributed mode it is only as good as the clock
synchronization between the publishing and subscribing hosts, and reports
over distributed runs should treat small fanout latencies accordingly.

## Query Timing

A `query` is one filter-query round trip measured on a single clock, so it
needs no cross-process convention:

- A query reader issues the workload's `query_filters` as one request and
  measures from sending the request to receiving the stored-result boundary
  (`EOSE` on Nostr relays).
- `result_count` on the metric event is the number of stored events
  delivered before the boundary.
- Deliveries after the boundary are live subscription traffic, not query
  results; the reader MUST end the query at the boundary (close the
  subscription) rather than let live events stretch its duration.
- A request that never reaches the boundary within the reader's timeout is
  a metric event with `status: "error"`, and the reader continues.

Query readers pace themselves with `workload.query_rate_per_second`
(default `1`), analogous to `workload.publish_rate_per_second`.

## Object Reads

An `object_read` is one request against the relay's derived-object read
surface — for Overnet relays, the HTTP endpoint defined by the relay
specification's Derived Object Reads section — measured as a request round
trip on a single clock:

- The read origin is derived from the relay endpoint by replacing the `ws`
  scheme with `http` (`wss` with `https`), because the relay specification
  places the object read endpoint on the same relay origin.
- `workload.object_reads.objects` lists the object references to read, each
  a mapping with non-empty `type` and `id` strings; readers cycle through
  them in order. `workload.object_reads.rate_per_second` (default `1`)
  paces the reads.
- A fulfilled read (HTTP `200`) is a metric event with `status: "success"`.
  A structured relay refusal (the relay specification's object read error
  table: `invalid`, `unauthorized`, `payment_required`, `policy_denied`,
  `not_found`, `unsupported`, `unavailable`) is a metric event with
  `status: "error"` carrying the relay's `error.code`, and the reader
  continues — refusals are behavior of the system under test, not worker
  failures.
- Object read metric events SHOULD carry `object_type`, `object_id`, and,
  for responses the relay actually produced, `http_status`.
- An endpoint that is unreachable before the workload starts is a fatal
  worker failure per Exit Semantics, not a metric.

## Reference Workers

| Role | Implementation |
|---|---|
| `publisher` | `overnet-burner worker` with `Overnet::Burner::Worker::Publisher` |
| `control_publisher` | `overnet-burner worker` with `Overnet::Burner::Worker::ControlPublisher` |
| `subscriber` | `overnet-burner worker` with `Overnet::Burner::Worker::Subscriber` |
| `query_reader` | `overnet-burner worker` with `Overnet::Burner::Worker::QueryReader` |
| `object_reader` | `overnet-burner worker` with `Overnet::Burner::Worker::ObjectReader` |
| `observer` | `overnet-burner worker` with `Overnet::Burner::Worker::Observer` |
| `syncer` | `overnet-burner worker` with `Overnet::Burner::Worker::Syncer` |
| `sync_bridge` | `overnet-burner worker` with `Overnet::Burner::Worker::SyncBridge` |
| `channel_lifecycle` | `overnet-burner worker` with `Overnet::Burner::Worker::ChannelLifecycle` |

The reference publisher derives a stable Nostr identity from
`seed`/`worker_id`, publishes valid native Overnet events (kind 7800 with the
required core tags, body stamped with `sent_at`) at
`workload.publish_rate_per_second`, waits for each relay acknowledgment, and
emits one `publish` metric event per attempt — `success` on acceptance,
`error` with the relay's reason on rejection or timeout.

The reference control publisher (`topology.control_publishers.count`) generates
the load an Overnet **authority** relay actually gates. An authority relay
accepts ordinary content (the publisher's kind-7800 events) from anyone; only
delegated NIP-29 group-control traffic goes through its delegation-authorization
path. The control publisher establishes its own authority peer-to-relay — no IRC
frontend required: it derives an authority/actor key and a delegated session
key, publishes a delegation grant (kind `grant_kind`, default 14142) binding the
session key to the relay, and publishes an initial operator put-user (kind 9000)
the relay accepts as the empty group's operator self-grant. It then streams
authorized put-user control events at `workload.publish_rate_per_second`, each
adding a fresh synthetic member, so the relay verifies the grant and the actor's
operator role for every event. Each attempt is one `control_publish` metric —
`success` on acceptance, `error` with the relay's reason on rejection or
timeout. On a lost connection it reconnects and re-establishes its authority
(which a restarted relay's fresh store no longer holds) before resuming.
`workload.control` may carry `grant_kind`, `group`, `scope`, and `relay_url`;
each defaults sensibly, and `relay_url` (the grant's relay binding) defaults to
the first relay endpoint, so it must be the relay's own configured relay-url. It
targets an authority relay such as the shipped
[`scenarios/authority-control-load.yml`](../scenarios/authority-control-load.yml)
points at; against a plain relay its control events are simply accepted without
exercising any authorization.

The reference channel lifecycle worker (`topology.channel_lifecycles.count`)
drives the **ordered lifecycle of a hosted channel** rather than a uniform
stream of one operation. It establishes its authority peer-to-relay exactly as
the control publisher does, then runs a repeating script: `create_channel` (a
delegated kind-39000 group metadata write, once), `add_user` (kind 9000
admitting a fresh member), `chat` (an ungated NIP-29 kind-9 group message signed
by an admitted member), `ban` (kind 9001 pubkey removal, the authoritative
exclusion mechanism), and `edit_settings` (kind 9002 edit-metadata). Ordering is
the point: a channel is created before members are admitted, members speak
before they are banned, and settings change over the channel's life, so the
relay authorizes against a channel whose membership and settings actually
change. Each attempt is one `channel_lifecycle` metric carrying
`lifecycle_step` and the `control_kind` published — `success` on acceptance,
`error` with the relay's reason otherwise. `workload.lifecycle` may carry
`channel_name`, `members_per_cycle`, `messages_per_cycle`, and `bans_per_cycle`;
`workload.control` carries the authority parameters as for the control
publisher. Member identities advance monotonically, so a banned member is never
silently re-admitted. See
[`scenarios/authority-channel-lifecycle.yml`](../scenarios/authority-channel-lifecycle.yml).

Running both authority roles together for hours is what finds capacity failures
that no short run can. A sixty-second run reports a healthy relay meeting its
configured rate at a zero error rate however many times it is repeated, because
each run starts against a fresh or barely-used store; what degrades is capacity,
and only as stored history accumulates. Pair the roles deliberately: point
`channel_lifecycle` at a fresh group each cycle and `control_publisher` at one
group for the whole run, so the two curves separate a cost that scales with
total relay history from one that scales with the group being operated on. The
report captures latency and error rate, so watch relay memory and store size
from outside the harness as well. See
[`scenarios/authority-soak.yml`](../scenarios/authority-soak.yml).

The reference subscriber subscribes to the first relay endpoint with
`workload.subscription_filters`, writes its readiness marker only after the
stored-event replay boundary (`EOSE`), and emits one `subscription_fanout`
metric event per stamped live event under the fanout timing convention
above.

The reference query reader issues `workload.query_filters` against the first
relay endpoint at `workload.query_rate_per_second` and emits one `query`
metric event per request under the query timing convention above — `success`
with `result_count` at the stored-result boundary, `error` on timeout.

The reference object reader cycles through `workload.object_reads.objects`
against the first relay endpoint's derived origin at
`workload.object_reads.rate_per_second` and emits one `object_read` metric
event per request under the object read convention above. It requires a
relay that implements the Overnet derived-object read endpoint; a plain
Nostr relay does not provide one.

The reference observer is the relay-side black-box evidence producer
(`topology.observers.count`): every
`workload.observer.probe_interval_seconds` (default `1`) it probes **every**
relay endpoint of the run — not just its assigned one — with a fresh
connection and an empty subscription, emitting one `relay_ping` metric
event per endpoint per tick. An unreachable relay is an error metric, never
an observer failure: watching relays die is the observer's job, so it
declares readiness immediately and probes through every phase, tagging each
event with the phase it ran in.

The reference syncer measures NIP-77 negentropy reconciliation cost against
the first relay endpoint (`topology.syncers.count`): every
`workload.syncer.interval_seconds` (default `1`) it opens a fresh
reconciliation session, and because it holds no local events the session
discovers how much of the relay's visible set (`workload.syncer.filters`,
default all) it would need to fetch and how many protocol rounds that takes.
It emits one `sync_round` metric event per session with `rounds`,
`have_count`, `need_count`, and `relay_url`. A session that cannot connect or
does not converge within `workload.syncer.timeout_seconds` (default `10`) is
an error metric, never a syncer failure — like the observer it is an
evidence producer, so it declares readiness immediately and reconciles
through every phase. It measures download-side reconciliation only; it does
not upload events to the relay.

The reference sync bridge converges its assigned relay set through negentropy
reconciliation (`topology.sync_bridges.count`). It connects to every endpoint in
`endpoints.relays` — the full relay list the runner's rotation assigns each
bridge — and every `workload.sync_bridge.interval_seconds` (default `1`) it runs
one convergence session: starting from an empty local set it folds over the
relays twice. The first pass reconciles each relay against the growing local
copy, fetching what that relay uniquely holds and pushing back what the copy
already carries, so by the last relay the copy is the full union and that relay
already holds it; the second pass revisits every earlier relay to push it the
union members it still lacked. After a session all relays hold the union of their
`workload.sync_bridge.filters` (default all) event sets. Two relays are the pair
case (`sync-pair`, `partition-and-recover`), three or more a convergence mesh
(`sync-mesh`); the fold costs `2n-1` reconciliations for `n` relays and reduces
to the classic primary-pull, peer-reconcile, primary-push exchange for a pair. It
emits one `sync_converge` metric per session with `rounds` (negentropy passes),
`fetched_count`, `pushed_count`, `relay_count`, and `left_url`/`right_url` (the
first and last relay of the set). Unlike the download-only syncer, the bridge is
an active participant: it uploads events to converge the set. A run whose
topology gives the bridge fewer than two relays, a relay it cannot reach, or a
session that does not converge within `workload.sync_bridge.timeout_seconds`
(default `10`) is an error metric, never a worker failure.
